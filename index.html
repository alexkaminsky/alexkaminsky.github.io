      I am a senior at Deerfield Academy who is interested in biochemistry, the environment, databases, and programming. I am a member of the programming group for the Deerfield Academy FIRST Robotics team. Over the past few summers, I have studied discrete mathematics at Stanford University and organic chemistry and databases at Harvard University.

  <div class="part part-text">
    <h5>Science Fair Project: <i>The Effects of Weather on Criteria Air Pollutants</i></h5>
    <h6 class="date">Fall and Winter of 2013</h6>
    <h6>
      Working with an MIT researcher and my brother, I conducted experiements relating changes in weather conditions to changes in the amount of particulate matter in the atmosphere. To do so, we used handheld devices along with a Raspberry Pi micro-computer attached to a weather balloon. For our work, we won an award from the American Society for Microbiology and competed in the state science fair.

    <h6 class="date">Since Winter of 2013</h6>
    <h6>
      My brother and I created this online code editor to address an issue which we had: the lack of online tools to edit code files stored on Google Drive. From this project, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and databases. It currently has 20,000 monthly users.

    <h5>Biogas Generator</h5>
    <h6 class="date">Since Spring of 2016</h6>
    <h6>
      In order to help reduce the waste produced by the dining halls of Deerfield Academy, I am working on a biogas generator to attempt to convert some of the uneaten food into usable natural gas. Deerfield's location near dairy farms allows me to get the manure I need to process the waste into gas. I also coded a Raspberry Pi to measure the gas production, and plan to vary the food scraps I put into the generator in an attempt to find the ideal fuel to produce the most pure natural gas.
    </h6>
    <h6>
      I am also working with the molecular modeling software VMD and NAMD to simulate the interactions between the enzymes in the cow manure and the cellulose in the food scraps

  <div class="part part-text">

    <h5>Harvard University Secondary School Program</h5>
    <h6 class="date">Summer of 2016</h6>
    <h6>
      At Harvard, I took an extremely intensive class on organic chemistry, which involved large amounts of lab work, and a class on databases. My chemistry classes only expanded my interest in the subject, and I hope to pursue biochemistry in college.
    </h6>

    <br/>

    <h5>Jack Kent Cooke Foundation Scholar</h5>
    <h6>
      The Foundation has been an enabling force behind many of my projects, which would have been out of my financial reach otherwise. As a scholar, I was able to get funding for parts such as large tanks of helium for my science fair project and parts to build a biogas generator.
    </h6>

    <br/>

    <h5>Award From the American Society fro Microbiology</h5>
    <h6 class="date">Winter of 2013</h6>
    <h6>
      For our science fair project, my brother and I recieved an award from the ASM at the regional level.
    </h6>

    <br/>

    <h5>Two Months Abroad in France</h5>
    <h6 class="date">Summer of 2015</h6>
    <h6>
      Deerfield Academy offers several summer trips abroad, and I sprung upon to opportunity to spend a few months practicing my French and immersing myself in a new culture. In addition to visiting some very well-known landmarks, I gained a greater understand of the culture, habits, and attitute of the French, as well as a greater appreciation for their culinary skill.
    </h6>

    <br/>

    <h5>Stanford University <i>Education Program For Gifted Youth</i></h5>
    <h6 class="date">Summer of 2013</h6>
    <h6>
      I studied discrete mathematics through the EPGY program, a stubject which is extremely important in theoretical computer science and game theory. Being at Stanford was an extremely exciting experience, since I was able to interact with some of the brightest students and professors in the country.

    <h6>
      I met Eben at an <i>American Association for the Advancement of Science</i> conference, and worked with him on my science fair project to correlate air pollution and weather conditions. He studies atmospheric chemistry and now works at Aerodyne Research, a company which builds atmospheric measurement equipment.
