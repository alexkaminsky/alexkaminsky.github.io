      I am a junior at Columbia University majoring in biomedical engineering and planning on attending medical school. My interests include biomedical research, atmospheric chemistry, and database management. Over the past few years, I completed an air pollution research project under the guidance of an MIT atmospheric chemist, worked alongside cancer researchers at the Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center, and performed research in the lab of Dr. Andrew Marks at Columbia University Medical Center.

      During my college career, I have served on the executive board of the Columbia University Charles Drew Pre-Medical Society, volunteered for over 100 hours at St. Luke's Hospital, and spent hundreds of hours performing research in Dr. Andrew Marks's lab at Columbia University Medical Center.

    <h5>Science Fair Project: <i>The Effects of Weather on Criteria Air Pollutants</i></h5>
    <h6 class="date">Fall and Winter of 2013</h6>
    <h6>
      Working with an MIT researcher and my brother, I conducted experiments relating changes in weather conditions to changes in the amount of particulate matter in the atmosphere. To do so, we used handheld devices along with a Raspberry Pi micro-computer attached to a weather balloon. For our work, we won an award from the American Society for Microbiology and competed in the state science fair.

    <h5>Biomedical Research Project: <i>Phenotypic and molecular characterization of FOXP2 knockdown in breast cancer cells</i></h5>
    <h6 class="date">Summer of 2017</h6>
    <h6>
      Working in the lab of Dr. Antoine Karnoub at the Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center, I completed a research project focusing on the transcription factor FOXP2 and its role in breast cancer metastasis. My work suggested that FOXP2 inhibition promotes metastasis in breast cancer cells by improving their ability to resist programmed cell death in anchorage-independent environments. I presented my findings at the Dana Farber Cancer Research Institute.

    <h5>Biomedical Research Project: <i>Phenotypic and Molecular Characterization of FOXP2 Knockdown in Breast Cancer Cells</i></h5>
    <h6 class="date">Summer of 2017</h6>
    <h6>
      I work in the lab of Dr. Andrew Marks, a lab primarily focused on the ryanodine receptor (RyR), a major calcium channel located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. I was assigned to a project involving RyR within the context of atrial fibrillation (AFib), the most common major arrhythmic condition in the world. Through assays such as lysate formation, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot, I found evidence of a potential pathway involving the RyR and mitochondrial reactive oxidative species (mROS) in AFib-induced mice. I have since continued to work in the same lab for several hours every week during the school year, contributing to a variety of projects and continuing to expand my knowledge of topics in biomedicine. In November 2019, I presented my work on atrial fibrillation at ABRCMS 2019 and ultimately won an award in the biochemistry division.

      My brother and I created this online code editor to address an issue we had: the lack of online tools to edit code files stored on Google Drive. From this project, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and databases. It currently has 20,000 monthly users.

    <h5>Biogas Generator</h5>
    <h6 class="date">Spring of 2016 to Spring of 2017</h6>
    <h6>
      In order to help reduce the waste produced by the dining halls of Deerfield Academy, I am working on a biogas generator to attempt to convert some of the uneaten food into usable natural gas. Deerfield's location near dairy farms allows me to get the manure I need to process the waste into gas. I also coded a Raspberry Pi to measure the gas production, and plan to vary the food scraps I put into the generator in an attempt to find the ideal fuel to produce the most pure natural gas.
    </h6>
    <h6>
      I am also working with the molecular modeling software VMD and NAMD to simulate the interactions between the enzymes in the cow manure and the cellulose in the food scraps.
